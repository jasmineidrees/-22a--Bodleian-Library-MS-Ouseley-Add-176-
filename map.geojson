    "description":"\"The Shahanama is one of the most influential pieces of literature to come out of Arabian culture to this day. The piece was written by Abu Al Qasim Firdawsi, a Perisan man who compiled thousands of oral tales from pre-islamic Persia about kings and heroes. The book itself is a compilation of poetry that retells these stories and is referred to as the Book Of Kings. The influence that this text had is exemplified by the widely dispersed recreation of manuscripts from the time of it's creation in the il-Khanid 13th century, to the end of the 17th century. The fables themselves remained the same, but the transmission of different cultural depictions of art and characterization demonstrated the esteem that it was held in. Manuscripts of the Shahnama were seen as valuable enough to represent a peace offering sent from Safavid ruler Shah Tahmasp I to Ottoman Sultan Selim II following battle. Throughout time variations within illustration occurred (as any monumental piece) and some even added post-Shahnama literature (Omidsalar, 2008). Its transfusion reached into countries such as India and Turkey, and illustrations began to include different cultural styles and symbolism of characters. The Shahnamas ability to surpass the rise and fall of dynasties is representative of the esteem held at the time towards the literary piece at it's time of influence and the manner in which we should regard the piece today.

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
