    "description":"\"The Shahanama is one of the most influential pieces of literature to come out of Arabian culture to this day. The piece was written by Abu Al Qasim Firdawsi, a Perisan man who compiled thousands of oral tales from pre-islamic Persia about kings and heroes. The book itself is a compilation of poetry that retells these stories and is referred to as the Book Of Kings. The influence that this text had is exemplified by the widely dispersed recreation of manuscripts from the time of it's creation in the il-Khanid 13th century, to the end of the 17th century. The fables themselves remained the same, but the transmission of different cultural depictions of art and characterization demonstrated the esteem that it was held in. Manuscripts of the Shahnama were seen as valuable enough to represent a peace offering sent from Safavid ruler Shah Tahmasp I to Ottoman Sultan Selim II following battle. Throughout time variations within illustration occurred (as any monumental piece) and some even added post-Shahnama literature (Omidsalar, 2008). Its transfusion reached into countries such as India and Turkey, and illustrations began to include different cultural styles and symbolism of characters. The Shahnamas ability to surpass the rise and fall of dynasties is representative of the esteem held at the time towards the literary piece at it's time of influence and the manner in which we should regard the piece today.\""},

    "description":"\"‘Jamshed Teaches Crafts’ follows the story of Jamshed, the Persian King who succeeds his father Tahmuras. Jamshed is not only a king, but he has mastered the craft of sorcery and is able to create materials. The time between his mastery of a specific craft is 50 years, and throughout his reign he begins by producing pertinent textiles and materials that build infrastructure and then moves on to more exuberant items such as jewels (Warner, 2007). Jamshed is supported by the masses and the people characterized within this folio are all there because of their free will, attributing their involvement to the belief they have of him. This specific folio illustrates the positivity in which Jamshed was received by the people he reigned over. The individuals illustrated are all visibly from different castes and ethnic dispositions, but all of them are within his court and supporting him. Besides their physicality, the ones who are engaging with him demonstrate a reciprocal openness in body language with him, that indicates that Jamshed’s relationship with his subjects is positive and they demonstrate respect for each other. The overarching story is ‘The Greatness and Fall of Jamshed’, so following this folio the story observes his fall from piousness. The Arthur George Warner translation describes his turn towards the dark side as; “God's Grace departed from him, The world was filled with din, the Court deserted, None who desired renown stayed in his presence…./Day darkened to Jamshid, he lost the Grace” (Warner, 2007). The folio we are currently observing is a stark contrast to Jamshed's eventual fate, but it is pivotal in developing the conditions of his reign when he was admired by his subjects.\""},

    "description":"\"The compilation of tales that the Shahnama is built upon, is based on characters that have created oral legacies that surpass their lifetime. The character of Jamshed is not only represented within the Shahnama, but it is also included within Zorostrian scripture predating the Shahnamah (DBpedia, accessed 2022). Linguistically, the name Jamshed is the Persian adaptation of the Zorostrian name ‘Yima Kshaeta’, and the resurgence of Jamshed within the Shahnama established the pre-existing notoriety of the Persian King. The character of Jamshed has been retold vigorously throughout Persian literature, and because of nuances that develop with retelling there are now many details that are disputed amongst the community regarding the life of Jamshed. There is much discourse on the relation between him and Tahmuras; the two striations of belief differ from him being his son or his brother. The Shahnama follows secular practice and it is more historically accurate according to the consensus on oral tellings (Omidsalar, 2008) . Another dispute amongst retellings of The Rise and Fall of Jamshed, is the length of his reign. Various versions of this story recount different time spans, and the range is from 400-1000 years. The stability of this storyline is found in its actual content, as there is very little variation to the underlying moral narrative. The strongest motif of Jamshed, is the power that greed has in instigating the downfall of a revered man. Jamshed’s fall from grace forces his followers to betray him and seek refuge from Zahhak, a man who is perceived as evil within the Shahnama. The pursuance of Zahhaks help later results in the gruesome death of Jamshed, who gets sawn in half. This folio is representative of the glory days within his leadership, and contrasted to later folios this is clearly developed by the use of light imagery. This encaptured period of time embellished Jamshed in positivity, which is equally as important as the later dark period.;\""},

    "description":"\"To encapsulate every specific detail of a narrative is virtually impossible in a visual manuscript unless captured in film. This folio’s text does not give a specific reference of the period of Jamshed’s rule that it is being spoken about but instead relies on visual aids that are complicit in storytelling. The materials being produced range from mercenary gear to a decadent piece of silk being hung right next to Jamshed. With the aid of the text, we are informed that Jamshed takes 50 years in order to master a new craft, and within his first 50 years, he masters the creation of iron. The placement and size of the silk itself indicate that this is an intentional placement that is actively being used to develop the storyline. The iron is highlighted in the bottom right corner, as it is being yielded into armoury. For the next 50 years, Jamshed used to master the creation of textiles such as 'Floss silk, hair, and cotton' (Warner, 2008). Despite the staggered timelines of material produced, various materials of production are being highlighted within this folio, signifying it would be 100 years after his rule. The placement of the various ornaments symbolizes the longevity and prosperity of his reign.\""},

    "description":"\"The use of colour within visual work is seen as one of the most important aspects in signifying the importance and depth of the piece, as well as the implicit symbolism of specific elements. Sentiments regarding particular symbolic insinuations of color differ based on both time period and its accompanying cultural environment. In this folio, none of the laborers surrounding Jamshed are wearing the same colors that his clothes or throne is made up of, corroborating the deliberate nature of color choice to establish a narrative. Within this point, we are going to focus specifically on the color characterization of Jamshed’s garments as well as his throne. Jamshed's throne is most notably adorned with red fabric, which in Persian literature is regarded as redāʾ al-kebrīā, the divine cloak of glory,(Soucek, 2011), and the emotions towards Jamshed's beloved reign during this time works interconnectedly with this cultural belief. A very fascinating aspect of this observation is that this color is not what his clothes are made of. Instead, he wears garments made up of dark blue. In Persian culture at the time, the use of dark blue in his clothing is resemblant of its connection to asceticism. This remains true as during this period in the story, Jamshed's devotion to learning crafts that result in the betterment of his community displays discipline and altruism. Similarly, the use of blue can also be interpreted as a negative color that may represent a being “who acts treacherously”(Soucek, 2011). With respect to the story, these interpretations mutually exist within Jamshed's character and storyline. While in the moment his glory is represented by the red embellishing his throne and the dark blue characterizing his discipline, the underlying element of his impending fall from piety can also be inferred.\""},
